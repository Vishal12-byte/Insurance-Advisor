# Agentic Insurance Advisor (AIA)

**A Multi-Agent Orchestration System for Actuarial-Grade Insurance Advisory**

Agentic Insurance Advisor (AIA) is a stateful, multi-agent expert system built on **LangGraph** that transforms static insurance workflows into an intelligent, explainable decision engine.

Unlike traditional chatbots or form-based insurance tools, AIA reasons through complex financial products, performs deterministic premium calculations, researches policy clauses using hybrid retrieval, and maintains long-running conversational state with **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** support.

## Core Architecture: The Thinking Graph

AIA is built using a **Supervisor–Worker agentic architecture** on top of LangGraph.  
Instead of a linear chatbot flow, the system dynamically plans, executes, and re-evaluates actions across specialized agents to answer complex insurance queries correctly.

### Autonomous Intent Orchestration
A **Master Supervisor Node** acts as the control layer. It continuously evaluates:
- user intent
- current conversation state
- missing or incomplete information
- which tools are required to proceed

For multi-intent queries (e.g. *“What is the premium for HDFC Life and does it cover terminal illness?”*), the supervisor:
- invokes the premium engine for deterministic pricing
- routes to policy experts for clause-level details
- loops and aggregates results into a single coherent response

This enables **tool chaining and re-planning**, rather than rigid one-shot responses.

### Hybrid RAG for Policy Accuracy ((Vector Search + Keyword Search))
Policy and rider details are retrieved using **Hybrid RAG** to prevent hallucinations:
- **Vector search** captures semantic intent (e.g. family security, future income)
- **Keyword & metadata filters** restrict retrieval by plan and insurer
- **Namespace isolation** separates free benefits from paid add-ons

This guarantees precise, regulation-safe policy explanations.

### Parallel Recommendation Pipeline
When recommendations are required, the Life Insurance subgraph triggers a **parallel fan-out**:
- **Premium Engine** computes exact prices using PostgreSQL-backed actuarial logic
- **Semantic Engine** matches user goals with plans and riders
- **Consultant Reasoner** explains *why* a plan is suitable

All outputs are synthesized by a **Merger Node** into a clear, professional recommendation.

## Memory & State Management

AIA separates **execution memory** from **knowledge memory** to ensure correctness, explainability, and scalability in a regulated domain.

### Conversational & Decision State
- **PostgreSQL Checkpointer**
  - Persists full conversation and graph state
  - Enables session resumption across restarts
  - Supports Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interruptions and resumes
  - Stores structured user facts (age, income, smoker status, intent)

### Knowledge Memory
- **Pinecone Vector Database**
  - Stores policy clauses, free benefits, paid add-ons, and insurer metadata
  - Uses multiple namespaces for strict plan and category isolation
  - Optimized for semantic retrieval, not numeric computation

This clear separation allows the system to remain **stateful and reliable**, while avoiding LLM hallucinations in pricing or eligibility decisions.

## Key Capabilities

- **Deterministic Pricing**  
  Premiums are calculated using real actuarial logic from SQL-backed tables and fixed formulas, never approximated or hallucinated by an LLM.

- **Explainable Recommendations**  
  Every recommendation includes a clear rationale grounded in user goals, eligibility rules, policy clauses, and financial logic.

- **Trust & Reliability Metrics**  
  Automatically evaluates Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) and Solvency Ratio to rank insurers by long-term reliability.

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**  
  Ambiguous inputs or missing critical data trigger controlled user clarification instead of unsafe assumptions.

- **Persistent Conversations**  
  Users can leave and resume sessions without losing extracted facts, progress, or decision context.

## Design Philosophy

AIA is **not a general-purpose chatbot**.

It is a **domain-specialized decision system** optimized for:

- correctness  
- compliance  
- explainability  
- predictable behavior  

The system answers insurance advisory questions exceptionally well and **gracefully deflects or reframes out-of-scope queries**.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Life insurance plan recommendation  
- Rider selection and explanation  
- Deterministic premium estimation  
- Policy clause clarification  
- Insurer comparison and trust analysis

## Summary

Agentic Insurance Advisor demonstrates how **agentic architectures, deterministic computation, and hybrid retrieval** can be combined to build reliable, production-grade financial advisory systems.

This project emphasizes **engineering rigor over chatbot novelty**, making it suitable for real-world deployment in regulated domains.
